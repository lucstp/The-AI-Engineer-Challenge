# Rule: Follow Consistent Naming Conventions

All identifiers, filenames, and constants must follow consistent naming patterns aligned with industry and project-specific standards.

- Use **PascalCase** for:
  - TypeScript types and interfaces
  - React component names
  - Class names
- Use **camelCase** for:
  - Variables
  - Functions and methods
  - Object keys (unless interfacing with external data)
- Use **kebab-case** for:
  - File and directory names
  - Slugs and static route segments
- Use **UPPERCASE** for:
  - Environment variables (e.g. `NODE_ENV`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  - Shared constant values that should not change at runtime

### Additional Guidelines:
- Avoid magic numbers and strings. Define constants with descriptive names (`MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`).
- Function and method names must begin with a verb (`getUser`, `submitForm`, `handleClick`) to clearly indicate their action.
