### Rules for Frontend

- Always ensure strong **visual clarity and contrast** — never place light text on a light background or compromise readability.
- Design with a **pleasant, intuitive UX**: boxes and containers should adapt fluidly to their content; avoid fixed dimensions where flexibility is expected.
- When collecting **sensitive information**, use appropriate masked input types (e.g., `type="password"`), and never log or expose this data.
- Use **Next.js (App Router)** as the framework of choice — it is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**, our target platform.
- Ensure the frontend is **fully testable locally** (`localhost`) even before Vercel deployment — support local `.env`, mock APIs, and SSR/ISR behavior.
- After building a UI or flow, always include **clear instructions or commands for how to run and test it**, either via local dev (`npm run dev`) or preview links.
- If using `zustand` with `persist`, ensure that **sensitive keys like API tokens are not exposed in the DOM or console**, and clearly document what is stored in `localStorage` and why.
