# Animation Guidelines

We support runtime animation using `motion/react` (Motion One or Framer Motion), while maintaining a strict separation between **animated behavior** and **static styling**.

---

## Allowed Practices

- Use `motion` components (`motion.div`, `motion.span`, etc.) to animate layout, visibility, or transitions.
- Use `style={{}}` **only for animated properties** that cannot be expressed in Tailwind, such as:
  - `opacity`
  - `width`, `height`, `scale`, `transform`
  - `translateX`, `translateY`, `rotate`
- Tailwind utility classes must be used for all **non-animated layout, typography, spacing, color, and structure**.

### Example of Correct Usage

```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
  className="text-lg font-semibold text-center text-blue-500"
/>
```

---

## Disallowed Practices

- Do not use `style={{}}` for static properties like padding, margin, color, fontSize, etc.
- Do not use CSS animations, `@keyframes`, styled-components, or external animation libraries.
- Avoid mixing inline style and Tailwind utilities for the same property (e.g., don't animate width while also using `w-32`).

## Implementation in Chat App

For our chat application, animation should be used strategically to enhance user experience:

- **Message Transitions**: Animate new messages appearing in the chat
- **Loading States**: Use subtle animations for loading indicators
- **Error States**: Animate error notifications to draw attention
- **Typewriter Effect**: Implement typewriter animation for AI responses
- **Modal Transitions**: Smooth transitions for modals and dialogs
