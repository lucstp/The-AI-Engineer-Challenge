## Rules to Follow

- Always commit your changes incrementally after completing each logical unit of work.
- Write self-explanatory code; when clarity is not obvious, use concise comments or JSDoc annotations.
- Only work on one feature or task at a time — every branch must isolate a single concern to ensure clarity, testability, and clean merges.
- Clearly explain your implementation decisions in PRs or handoffs — include the “why”, not just the “what”.
